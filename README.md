# Ophiuroid Neuropeptidome

## Introduction

Here are the scripts that we used to analyse the Ophuroid Neuropeptidomes. Specifically the attached scripts where used to align the neuropeptide homologs and produce annotated word files (in reality a HTML file with a `.docx` file ending).

Note: The above scripts were customised to our use-case; but can be easily adapted to run with other data.
